# Security Policy

_EMBA_ is a platform for optimizing our research and testing tasks in the field of IoT, OT, ICS and general embedded analysis. Because of this, we include code quite early and sometimes in a very raw state. We do not recommend setting up _EMBA_ as a productive environment or in an unprotected environment! If you are using _EMBA_ you should know what you are doing.
