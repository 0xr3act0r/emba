# Security Policy

EMBA is a platform for optimizing our research and testing tasks in the field of IoT, OT and general embedded analysis. Because of this, we include code quite early and sometimes in a very raw state. We do not recommend setting up EMBA as a productive environment or in an unprotected environment! If you are using EMBA you should know what you are doing.
